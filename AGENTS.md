# Working on Software Factory

Read the relevant part of `docs/design.md` before changing a coordination contract. Keep specialist judgment distinct from mechanical execution and classifier routing. Every Jev question must offer an explicit `uncertain` outcome.

Run `python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`, `python3 scripts/check_design.py` and `acr validate . --json` for relevant changes. Ordinary tests use recorded decisions/fake transports; they must not contact providers or manipulate live Rex sessions. The explicitly invoked `scripts/smoke_rex.py` is a separate live conformance check that creates only its own test session and panes.

Keep instructions short and role-specific. Store operational facts once and generate views from them. A passing package validator or contract test does not establish live integration, judgment quality, subscription eligibility or release readiness. Preserve the user's existing authorization boundaries and repository coding/release policy.

## Operator-approved exceptions

For Software Factory's runtime and explicitly invoked conformance checks, native provider CLIs may execute operator-authorized specialist assignments through the factory's Rex adapter. This does not authorize the coding agent's own native subagents, team tools or delegation wrappers outside those factory runtime checks. User scope, task limits, isolated worktrees, permissions and release gates remain binding.

For this repository's operator-admitted writer tasks, explicitly selecting
`--write --commit-message` also authorizes factory-owned local Git staging/commit
and the repository's configured hooks, filters and signing helpers with normal
host access, including when they load writer-edited source. Native model
commands run without approval prompts or harness sandboxes, as described in
[native providers](docs/native-providers.md#execution-policy). This exception
does not authorize pushes, merges, publication, task acceptance or bypassed
CI/review gates.

The operator temporarily waives waiting for Claude quality review while its subscription capacity is unavailable, expected to return Saturday afternoon, 2026-11-07 (America/Chicago). Current-head policy review and required CI still gate merges. Restore the Claude review requirement when capacity returns; never record the waived review as an approval.

## ACR package: github:jbaruch/coding-policy

### Rule: agent-worktree-isolation


# Agent Worktree Isolation

## Required Read

- Before concurrent repository inspection or writes, worktree or branch lifecycle operations, or cleanup reporting, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/agent-worktree-isolation.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Isolate writes that may run concurrently with another agent in a separate git worktree and task branch.
- Main-checkout concurrent inspection stays read-only.
- Preserve unrelated work.
- Remove only this task's owned worktree through the binding cleanup order.
- During cleanup, never touch or report a protected origin branch.
- A single-machine single-agent workflow may proceed without a worktree.

### Rule: boy-scout


# Boy Scout Rule

## The Principle

- Leave the authorized task surface in better shape than you found it
- An observation grants no authority to expand the task, write another repository, or create external follow-up work
- Fix a defect when it is coherent with the task's accepted behavior and authorized scope

## How to Apply

- **In-scope defect** — fix it in the current change and test the outcome
- **Unrelated blocking risk** — record it once with evidence, consequence, owner if known, and required next decision: in the existing authorized task record or current conversation
- **Advisory** — use `rules/review-severity.md` Split Reading From Acting
- Open an issue, pull request, or other external record only when the task or operator separately authorizes that action

## Fold Into a Round Already in Flight

- Advisory folding follows `rules/review-severity.md` Split Reading From Acting
- Maintenance due in another repository and unrelated checkout hygiene stay observations
- These observations never become prerequisites for the selected task

## Reconciliation With `commit-conventions`

- `rules/commit-conventions.md` keeps each commit and pull request focused
- Record an unrelated risk instead of bundling its repair into the current change

### Rule: ci-safety


# CI Safety

## Required Read

- Before branch, commit or CI work, authoring commit messages, reading or handling PR reviews, merges, publication, release-helper lookup, or any CI exception, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/ci-safety.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Do not change CI outside the authorized scope.
- Never skip failing tests or bypass review.
- Never push directly to protected branches outside a binding carve-out.
- Watch every push to its required terminal gates.
- Helper lookup grants no merge, publication, installation or operator authority.

### Rule: code-formatting


# Code Formatting

## Use the Project's Tools

- Use whatever formatter and linter the project already has configured
- Don't introduce a new formatter without team consensus
- Don't bikeshed style — let the tooling decide

## CI Integration

- Run format/lint checks before tests in CI — catch style issues early and cheaply
- Format checks should be a separate CI step that runs fast

## Separation of Concerns

- Never mix formatting changes with functional changes in the same commit
- If code needs reformatting, do it in a dedicated commit before or after the functional change
- This keeps diffs reviewable and bisectable

## Basics

- Remove trailing whitespace
- End files with a single newline
- Use consistent indentation (whatever the project standard is)
- These should be enforced by editor config or pre-commit hooks, not manual effort

### Rule: commit-conventions


# Commit Conventions

## Commit Messages

- **Imperative mood** in the subject line: "Add feature", not "Added feature" or "Adds feature"
- Subject line ~50 characters; hard limit at 72
- Body explains **why**, not what — the diff shows what changed
- Separate subject from body with a blank line

## One Change Per Commit

- Each commit represents one logical change
- Don't mix refactors with features, formatting with bug fixes, or dependency updates with code changes
- If you need to refactor before implementing, that's a separate commit

## Pull Requests

- CI must pass before merging — sole exception: `rules/ci-safety.md` Bootstrap-Red Carve-Out
- PR title follows `<type>(<scope>): <imperative summary>` format
- The PR title is the changelog line
- Never add a CHANGELOG entry in a PR
- Keep PRs focused — large PRs are hard to review and risky to merge

### Rule: context-artifacts

Apply only when a working path matches: .tessl-plugin/plugin.json, agent-plugin.yaml, rules/**, skills/**, .tesslignore, CHANGELOG.md, README.md


# Context Artifacts

## Required Read

- Before authoring, modifying, reviewing or publishing plugin artifacts in any distribution, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/context-artifacts.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Keep plugin surfaces synchronized.
- Validate and review every applicable distribution before publication.

### Rule: context-writing-style

Apply only when a working path matches: rules/**/*.md, skills/**/SKILL.md, README.md, CHANGELOG.md


# Context Writing Style

## Required Read

- Before writing plugin prose or its PR descriptions, judging policy edge cases, debugging directives or auditing rules, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/context-writing-style.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Keep loaded rules and skills compact.
- Retain binding constraints.
- Move detail to explicitly read references.

## Full-Contract Task Router

- Narrow exception for a full-contract task router.
- Applies when a rule routes its complete single-concept contract to a co-shipped skill reference.
- Preconditions (all required):
  1. Preserve the rule's applicability, title and affected-action trigger.
  2. Require the full reference before every affected action, including reliance on an exception.
  3. Preserve every original directive, carve-out trigger, applies-when clause, precondition, pointer and reset in the reference.
  4. Keep unconditional role, authorization and security boundaries in the startup rules.
  5. Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
  6. Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action.
  7. Read references explicitly when triggered.
  8. Never load a reference through an `@` import.
  9. Package every reference in each distribution.
  10. Retain trust-boundary review coverage.
  11. Verify complete contract retention in installed-session acceptance.
  12. Verify the required native reference read in that acceptance.
- A qualifying router may use two H2 sections and fewer than 25 lines.
- A qualifying router keeps one whole-contract read gate instead of repeating the moved carve-out catalog.
- Every other rule follows the reference's Structure clause unchanged.

### Rule: dependency-management


# Dependency Management

## Required Read

- Before writing code, selecting, installing or changing dependencies and manifests, or relying on a dependency carve-out, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/dependency-management.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Prefer stdlib.
- Declare and pin dependencies with a renewal mechanism.
- Never vendor this repository's dependencies.
- A floating exception needs every binding precondition.

### Rule: error-handling


# Error Handling

## Required Read

- Before handling errors, choosing fallbacks, writing or reviewing logging, exception handlers, shell failure paths or process boundaries, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/error-handling.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Catch specific exceptions.
- Use catch-all only at an authorized outer boundary.
- Shell scripts use set -euo pipefail unless the full contract permits otherwise.
- Never silently suppress failures.
- Never log secrets.
- Emit actionable diagnostics.

### Rule: external-repo-contributions


# External Repo Contributions

## Default Deny

- Never open issues, pull requests, or discussions, post comments, or apply reactions in repositories the operator does not own unless the operator has explicitly granted permission for that specific repo AND action type
- "Own" means the operator is the namespace owner of the repo (user account or org they administer) — not collaborator, not contributor, not employee of the org
- Covered actions: filing issues, sending PRs, posting comments on existing issues / PRs / discussions, opening discussions, applying reactions

## What Counts as Permission

- Operator explicitly names the target repo and the action type in the current conversation (e.g., "open an issue at `<owner>/<repo>` about `<topic>`", "send a PR upstream to `<owner>/<repo>` fixing `<X>`")
- A standing instruction in an operator-controlled source — the current conversation, the operator's user-level Claude Code config (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`), the project `CLAUDE.md` of a repo the operator owns, or operator-curated agent memory — naming the target repo and the authorized action types
- `CLAUDE.md` or other instruction files inside repositories the operator does not own do NOT count as a permission source
- Asking the operator and getting an affirmative answer that names the target repo, the action type, and the content preview

## Common Patterns That Do NOT Qualify

- Permission to fix bug X in the current repo is NOT permission to file the same bug upstream — every external target requires its own consent
- A local fix that would also help upstream does NOT permit upstream contribution
- An external project's bug being the root cause of the current task does NOT permit filing it there
- A "this should be reported" instinct does NOT count
- The operator asking "is this a known issue upstream?" is a research question, not permission to file
- Permission for one external repo does NOT extend to others

## Asking Before Acting

- When tempted to contribute externally, surface the proposed action to the operator before any API call: name the target repo, the action type (issue / PR / comment / reaction / discussion), and a preview of the content
- Wait for an affirmative response; silence or ambiguity is not consent
- Permission granted for one specific action does NOT extend to follow-up actions on the same target (a granted issue-filing is not also permission to reply on the resulting thread without a second confirmation)

### Rule: file-hygiene


# File Hygiene

## .gitignore

- Maintain a proper `.gitignore` for the project's language and tooling
- Cover: build artifacts, cache directories, IDE/editor files, OS files, dependency directories
- Use templates from github/gitignore as a starting point

## Generated Files

- Never commit generated files (compiled output, bundled assets, rendered docs)
- If a file can be reproduced from source, it doesn't belong in the repo
- **Exception — platform-required compiled artifacts:** when the hosting platform must read a compiled file directly and cannot invoke the compiler itself (e.g., gh-aw `.lock.yml` workflow files compiled from `.md` sources by `gh aw compile`; dependency lock files like `package-lock.json`, `Cargo.lock`, `go.sum`), commit both source and compiled form. Mark the compiled file as generated via `.gitattributes` (`linguist-generated=true`, `merge=ours`) so diffs stay readable and merges don't conflict
- Per-machine installer state is not a dependency lock file (see `rules/dependency-management.md` Pinning)

## Standalone Scripts

- Scripts must have entry-point guards (e.g., `if __name__ == "__main__"` in Python, `if (require.main === module)` in Node)

## I/O Conventions

- stdout for program output, stderr for errors and diagnostics
- Exit 0 on success, non-zero on failure
- Use meaningful exit codes when the platform supports them

## Idempotency

- Scripts should be safe to run multiple times
- Don't fail if a directory already exists, a file was already processed, or a resource was already created

## Session Scratchpads

- Use `.coding-policy-disposable/` inside an available native scratchpad for reproducible files and temporary environments.
- Keep deliverables, continuation material, shared files and background-task inputs outside it.
- SessionEnd cleanup follows `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__release/hooks/session-end-cleanup.py`'s contract.

### Rule: hook-action-reporting


# Hook Action Reporting

## Surface the Status

- A SessionStart hook emits an `additionalContext` payload beginning with `Session-start status — ` only when it has a status to report
- Many outcomes emit nothing (non-repo, no matching dependency)
- At session start, collect every such payload the context carries (there may be none) and relay each in full as one block, before the first substantive action
- A payload may span several lines, a marker line plus continuation lines such as an update list or a `NOTE:`
- Relay the whole payload, never only its marker line
- Report the block once per session, at the start, never repeating it every turn
- Relay the payloads verbatim, without padding or restating them as your own analysis

## Act on What It Names

- A payload may name an action: a branch to sync, a pinned dependency to fix, an update that failed
- After relaying the block, act on any such action per its governing rule
- An all-green status needs only the report, no further action
- A status may list worktrees and branches awaiting an operator decision
- Raise each listed item with the user, one question at a time
- Offer the choices push, commit, open a pull request, delete, or keep
- Never push, commit, stash, delete or discard a listed item unasked

## Reconciliation With `response-clarity`

- Narrow exception for the session-start status block to `rules/response-clarity.md` Lead With the Action
- Preconditions (all required):
  1. The block appears once per session, at the start, before the first substantive action
  2. It carries only the `Session-start status — ` payloads, nothing else
- Every other turn opens with the action, no status block

### Rule: language-diagnostics


# Language Diagnostics

## Required Read

- Before working on code, configuring diagnostic engines or handing off code changes, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/language-diagnostics.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Use the existing language engine in the editor.
- Run its zero-findings deterministic gate in CI and before handoff.
- Fix findings or attach a stated-cause inline suppression.
- Never silence a whole file.

### Rule: no-secrets


# No Secrets

## Never Commit Secrets

- Never commit API keys, tokens, passwords, private keys, or `.env` files
- This includes test/development credentials — they tend to leak into production
- If a secret was committed, rotate it immediately — removing the commit is not enough

## Use Environment Variables or Secrets Managers

- Read secrets from environment variables or a secrets manager at runtime
- Never hardcode credentials in source code, config files, or scripts

## Document Required Variables

- Maintain a `.env.example` file listing every required environment variable with placeholder values
- Document what each variable is for and where to get the value
- For hosted-CI secrets, include a deep link to the platform's secrets configuration page in the file header so a new maintainer can reach the settings page in one click (GitHub Actions: `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/settings/secrets/actions`; GitLab CI: `https://gitlab.com/<group>/<project>/-/settings/ci_cd`)

## Pre-commit Scanning

- Use pre-commit hooks for secret scanning (e.g., detect-secrets, gitleaks, trufflehog)
- Block commits that contain patterns matching secrets

## Logging

- **Never log secrets** — not at any log level, not in error messages, not in stack traces
- Sanitize or redact sensitive values before they reach any logging or monitoring system

### Rule: response-clarity


# Response Clarity

## Scope

- Governs the agent's live responses to the user, not context artifacts (rules, skills, READMEs — those follow `rules/context-writing-style.md`)
- Applies every turn, in every session

## Lead With the Action

- Open with the command, edit, or answer — never context, preamble, or restated question
- Number multi-step work
- Keep each numbered item to one bounded action, no compound "and then" clause
- Cap an unranked list at 5 items
- Split a longer list into "do now" and "later" tiers
- Defer secondary issues — finish the primary problem, then offer the rest as separate follow-ups
- Cut hedging adverbs that carry no uncertainty ("basically", "essentially", "practically")
- Keep a hedge that carries real uncertainty ("might", "perhaps", "possibly")
- Replace an idiom or figurative phrase ("circle back", "on the same page") with the literal action

## Show State and Progress

- Restate progress across turns: "Step 3 of 5 done: schema updated. Next: backfill the column"
- Make a win concrete and verifiable — name what works and the command that shows it
- Give a concrete time ballpark ("~15 minutes if tests exist"), never vague "some work"

## Report Errors Plainly

- State a failure matter-of-fact: what failed, where, expected versus actual
- No softening, no apology spiral

## Close With One Next Step

- End with one concrete action the user can take in two minutes or less
- No recap, no pleasantries, no closer
- End when the answer is done

## Exceptions

- Explanation requested — give full detail, still no preamble
- Destructive or irreversible action — add a confirmation step before running it
- Debug spiral — ask one diagnostic question instead of guessing
- Genuine ambiguity with no obvious default — ask one clarifying question, then proceed

### Rule: review-severity


# Review Severity

## Categories and Evidence

- Prefix messages with `[defect]`, `[policy mismatch]` or `[optional hardening]`.
- Defects require a concrete trigger, reachable path and material consequence.
- Policy mismatches cite binding clauses and source.
- Identify unproven harm as unproven.
- Optional hardening adds safeguards without a demonstrated defect or obligation.

## Severity and Remedy

- Blocking: substantiated material defects, tests concealing them, or binding obligations affecting meaning or behavior.
- Advisory: optional hardening and presentation-only suggestions.
- A behavior-changing suggestion alone never establishes a blocker.
- Resolve mismatches through compliant code or authorized policy amendment and re-review.
- Reviewers cannot waive policy.
- Apply `rules/simplicity.md` to remedy cost and scope.

## Merge Gate

- Any blocker → `CHANGES_REQUESTED`; otherwise `APPROVED` or `COMMENTED`.
- Retain both independent review gates.

## Judge-Weighed Finding Carve-Out

- Narrow exception for merging with a blocking policy finding a weighing ruled `defer` or `decline`.
- Applies only when fixing costs more than the failure it prevents.
- Preconditions are binding: read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__release/references/review-severity-carve-outs.md` Judge-Weighed Finding Carve-Out before relying on it.
- Every other blocker is resolved before merge.

## Split Reading From Acting

- Read all feedback under `rules/reviewer-feedback-reading.md`.
- Advisory → note it directly in the existing review conversation or authorized task record.
- Fold advisories into required same-surface fixes only without another push or check round.
- Advisories require no push, review round, issue, PR or delivery prerequisite.

### Rule: reviewer-feedback-reading


# Reviewer Feedback Reading

## Independent Review Context

- This contract governs feedback disposition and release readiness
- An independent read-only review may use a bounded historical index to locate contracts and prior source identities; an index never disposes of feedback or establishes that it needs no action
- A fresh current-head review assesses current source independently; its verdict does not claim prior feedback was read or handled
- Before disposing of feedback or merging, the author/release handler still reads every full review body and inline comment through `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__release/poll-pr-reviews.sh` and GitHub's original feedback; omitted or unavailable index entries remain unread

## State Classifies Gating, Not Reading

- A review's state (`APPROVED`, `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, `COMMENTED`) classifies whether the review gates the merge — it never classifies whether the review's content must be read
- `COMMENTED` and "non-blocking" describe the merge gate, never permission to skip the review body
- Read every reviewer's review body in full and every inline comment body before judging that any item needs no action
- A `COMMENTED` review with zero inline comments still carries a body that must be read
- State classifies gating, severity classifies acting, neither classifies reading — read all, then act per `rules/review-severity.md`

## Read the Text, Not the Tally

- Review states and inline-comment counts are loop-control and gate signals, never a substitute for the words a reviewer wrote
- Fetch the actual review body and inline comment text; conclude an item is non-blocking only after reading it
- "Non-blocking" is a conclusion reached after reading, never a reason to not read

## Report the Substance

- Never report a reviewer as handled by its state label alone — "COMMENTED (non-blocking)" is not a summary of what the reviewer said
- Name each reviewer whose body you read and summarize the content, not the classification
- Lumping reviewers under one state label hides unread feedback — account for each reviewer's body separately

### Rule: rule-frontmatter

Apply only when a working path matches: rules/**/*.md


# Rule Frontmatter

## Required Read

- Before authoring, interpreting or changing rule frontmatter and activation scope, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/rule-frontmatter.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Frontmatter narrows applicability at the model layer; Tessl still imports the complete declared rule bytes.

### Rule: script-as-black-box

Apply only when a working path matches: skills/**/SKILL.md, skills/**/*.md


# Script as Black Box

## Required Read

- Before authoring skills or references that invoke scripts, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/script-as-black-box.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Describe inputs, outputs, failures and side effects.
- The script owns internal thresholds, predicates and allowlists.

### Rule: script-delegation

Apply only when a working path matches: skills/**, scripts/**, skills/**/*.sh, skills/**/*.py, skills/**/SKILL.md


# Script Delegation

## Required Read

- Before choosing, authoring or invoking scripts, bounded classifiers and automation, or choosing model reasoning, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/script-delegation.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Deterministic logic uses executable scripts.
- Bounded classification needs its approved bounds.
- Reasoning stays with the model.
- Classification approval waives no unrelated gate.
- It grants no authority for third-party communication, data deletion or merge.

### Rule: ship-on-green


# Ship on Green

## Green Gate Is the Approval

- Required checks green and none of the exits below apply ⇒ merge. The green gates ARE the approval
- Do not pause to ask a human whether to merge
- Flag, confirm, "say go and I'll", "worth one confirmation", "want me to?" are asking in a costume — each resolves to asking, and asking IS the decision to not ship
- Governs every merge, whether or not `skills/release` was invoked — an agent running the flow by hand is bound identically

## Stakes Raise Care, Not Permission

- Scary, wide-reaching, always-on, ships-to-prod, deletes-a-thing ⇒ verify harder — more tests, tighter review, a pristine-checkout lint
- A change being high-impact is never itself an exit — stakes buy care, never permission

## The Three Exits Are Exhaustive

- Merge is blocked only by one of these three, each with a literal test — no fourth exit, no vibe word:
- **Red** — a required check is failing or pending. Not "I feel uneasy"
- **No undo** — `git revert` cannot restore it: force-push over protected history, an immutable published artifact, deleted data, sent external comms. A supersedable version bump is undoable; shipping to prod is NOT "no undo"
- **Murky** — the task's own source states 2+ conflicting options AND names no default. Source names a default ⇒ take it, never murky

## Relationship to Other Rules

- `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__release/SKILL.md` Step 7 references this rule for the merge decision rather than restating it
- The release contract's watch and verify steps (`rules/ci-safety.md`) feed the Red test; they add no fourth exit
- Advisory findings never gate (`rules/review-severity.md`), so an unaddressed advisory does not make a gate Red

### Rule: simplicity


# Simplicity

## KISS and YAGNI

- Choose the simplest design that solves the stated problem today.
- Build nothing for a need nobody has today.
- Overengineering is forbidden.
- Add no option, flag, schema version, fallback, abstraction or extension point without a current caller or an observed failure.
- One caller gets no abstraction.
- One value gets no setting.
- Future consumers justify no machinery.
- Prefer deleting code, state and process over adding them.
- Delete code, options and files a change leaves unused in that change.

## Before Implementation

- State problem and smallest sufficient solution in conversation or PR.
- Try scoped instructions, agent actions, platform behavior or deletion before automation.
- Treat issue proposals as suggestions; explain simpler options' gaps before adopting machinery.
- Justify custom state, recovery, coordination and abstractions with requirements and platform gaps.
- Weigh maintenance, rollout and failures against likelihood and impact.
- Explain briefly.
- Add no approval gate.

## During Review

- Apply `rules/review-severity.md`.
- Flag machinery added without the justification above as a `[policy mismatch]` against this rule.
- Recommend smallest sufficient remedy.
- Consider deletion or authorized policy narrowing before safeguards.
- Keep policy binding until an authorized amendment takes effect.

## Calibration

- Before model comparisons, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/review-calibration.md` in full.
- Calibrate on demand, never as a merge gate.

### Rule: skill-authoring

Apply only when a working path matches: skills/**/SKILL.md, skills/**/*.md, .tessl-plugin/plugin.json, agent-plugin.yaml


# Skill Authoring

## Required Read

- Before authoring or reviewing skills, references and manifests, or relying on a skill invocation or lookup exception, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/skill-authoring.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Keep SKILL.md an ordered execution plan.
- Use typed cross-skill calls.
- Use the declared script lookup contract.

### Rule: stateful-artifacts


# Stateful Artifacts

## Required Read

- Before creating, reading, writing, migrating, renaming or removing persistent state artifacts, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/stateful-artifacts.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Require an owner, versioned schema and reader/writer contract.
- Verify recalled state against its live source.
- Only the owner migrates.

### Rule: sync-before-work


# Sync Before Work

## Sync Before Reading

- At the start of any task that will read or modify a repo, sync the local checkout with the remote default branch
- Run `git fetch origin` before the first read — not after the first failure
- The default branch you start from must match what the remote currently has, not whatever the local clone was left at

## Land on the Fresh Default

- On the default branch: fast-forward to `origin/<default>`
- Local default diverged or stale: rebase or reset onto `origin/<default>` before branching
- Cut the feature branch from the synced default, never from a stale local tip

## Staleness Poisons Conclusions

- Local default behind `origin/<default>` by more than a trivial amount: treat every "this file looks like X" conclusion as suspect until re-derived against the fresh tree
- An issue naming files, skills, or steps absent from the local tree is a staleness tell — fetch and re-derive before mapping the work onto what you see

## Working Against a Pinned Ref

- Narrow exception for starting work from a specific older ref instead of the fresh default
- Preconditions (all required):
  1. The user explicitly names the older ref or commit to work against
  2. You state you are starting from that pinned ref rather than `origin/<default>`
- Every other task starts from the synced remote default

### Rule: testing-standards


# Testing Standards

## Required Read

- Before writing or reviewing shipped code, building fixtures, running tests or relying on a test exemption, or relying on any exception to this rule, read `.codex/skills/acr__jbaruch__coding-policy__coding-contracts/references/testing-standards.md` in full.
- Its full text and named sections bind as rule content.
- Resolve the reference within its owning installed plugin.
- Missing or unreadable content stops the affected action until the plugin is repaired.
- Read explicitly when triggered.
- Never `@`-import the reference.

## Boundary

- Every shipped module has tests.
- Assert outcomes with fixed independent fixtures.
- Keep tests deterministic.
- A test exemption needs every binding precondition.
